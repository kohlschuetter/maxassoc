# maxassoc

A little program to override the maximum number of stations that can associate with an Android phone when tethering (sharing the data connection over WiFi).

## Usage

Invoke the binary without any parameters.

```
$ ./maxassoc
```

## Supported Devices

Currently, only Broadcom chipsets are supported (and not all of them may work).

Tested working on:

* Sony Xperia Z2 running Android 4.4

## Limitations

This is pretty much a working hack at this point.
It's hard-coded to set the maximum number of stations for wlan0 to 32.

## How it works

The program uses the brcm80211 wlioctl interface to send a WLC_SET_VAR command with the "maxassoc" command. That's it.

## Installation

Modify the Makefile to point to the right cross-compiler and Android sources, then run `make`.

## License
