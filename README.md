# maxassoc

A little program to override the maximum number of stations that can associate with an Android phone when tethering (sharing the data connection over WiFi).

## Limitations

This is pretty much a working hack at this point.
The maximum number of stations is hard-coded to 32.

## Supported Devices

Currently, only Broadcom chipsets are supported (and not all of them will work).

Tested working on:

* Sony Xperia Z2 running Android 4.4

## Installation

Modify the Makefile to point to the right cross-compiler and Android sources.

## License
